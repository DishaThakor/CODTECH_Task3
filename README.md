# Task 3 : END-TO-END DATA SCIENCE PROJECT
✅ Project Description
This is an End-to-End Data Science project, covering all stages from data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to model deployment. The final trained model is deployed using Flask or FastAPI, showcasing its functionality through a simple API or web application interface.

✅ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
  Pandas & NumPy — For data collection and preprocessing
  Matplotlib & Seaborn — For exploratory data analysis and visualization
  Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / XGBoost — For model building and training
  Flask / FastAPI — For building and deploying the API or web application
  Joblib / Pickle — For saving the trained model
  HTML / CSS — For the front-end interface (if applicable)
  Render / Railway / Heroku — For cloud deployment
